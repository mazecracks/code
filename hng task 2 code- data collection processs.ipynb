It is well oooooo. || Goverment should develop places like ikorodu, it is far far better than all these fake places || Sorry for those homes that are flooded; hopefully the government will act swiftly to mitigate the situation and assist its citizens.  The flooding is happening globally, especially to construction next to the water ,  below sea level, lagoon, or water pathway.  Everyone should investigate the area for flood before building and purchasing. || Later they ll be making mouth they cant live on the mainland , they cant live there, what am i going to do there ? were they born in Lekki? || 😮😅 || This is what happens when a country lacks systems and structures. Most of this premium estates in Nigeria are in-fact considered ghettos in the first world. Real estate development goes beyond building fancy houses. We have to learn to develop lands and lay proper infrastructure before building on it otherwise we’d keep having these issues, and end up creating beautiful ghettos which are bound to be demolished by future generations.\\n\\nEverything in Nigeria is about making quick money. Nobody cares about standards and creating legacy for our generations unborn. We travel to Europe and the Americas to tour structures built over 500 years ago that are still standing. Travel the length and breath of Nigeria, there is nothing. Our architects have even become so lazy that they can’t ideate. You get an architect to do a project for you and all you get back is copy and paste drawings.\\n\\nEven worse is the fact that the business of real estate agency in Nigeria is unregulated. I learnt this recently and was amazed at the systemic failure that allows such to operate. Every where you go in the world, agents are regulated and required to be registered to their state of practice and attain certain level of training with further requirements for continuous professional developments in other to professionally service the public in line with the laws. However this is none existent in Nigeria which explains why agents can unilaterally jack up property prices with no basis, just to earn more commissions, as you mentioned in one of your videos and even have prospective purchasers pay agency fees that should have been paid by the seller whom the agents are representing.\\n\\nThere has also been incidents where agents provide falsified information to Diasporean buyers claiming the area is not flood prone, whereas it is, just to seal a deal, an act that gives a buyer the right to withdraw from such deal in developed nations at any time as it is classed contract procured through fraud. But in Nigeria there appears not to be any consequences for this and other despicable behaviour hence the reason it keeps happening.\\n\\nSo until we fix our systems and processes, am afraid no amount of demolition could help us. Valuations, town and city planning need to be taken seriously if we would ever get out of this rot we have found ourselves. \\n\\nImagine selling a property for millions of Naira which cannot be underwritten, collateralised or backed up by a basic bank valuation.\\n\\nThe whole system appears to be one big joke! || They built houses where water is supposed to go through. Town planners and developers need to bring an end to this nonsense! || It does not help that everything is covered with concrete. There is no earth or grass to soak up rain, then added to that the lack of any drainage system. People still have boreholes and cholera is a problem. I was looking to invest in Lagos property but after what I saw on a trip last year there I was disappointed. Nigeria just does not work. Let me keep my money in UK and investigate Ghana, South Africa 😑😑 || lolzz, this water dont have any where to go? is channeling water rocket science for Africans? You people should keep pushing government propagandas! || Why do Nigerians give big attention to something because of pride. Every body wants to live in lekki even when its sinking 😂 everybody wants to use iPhone even when they don’t have money to pay for subscriptions, so many stupidity in a country without 24hour  light that if they see 23 hour light they’re proud of it 😂 || Tinubu the Lagos you build is fooled you want apc to rule edo again you lie apc is dead in Nigeria you are dreaming || You guy's have build houses everywhere and if the government wanted to pull down some structures now,people's will complain again || Rain never start well, and it's flooded like this. Ok ooo || Bad planning, poor drainages no flood gates, no pumping stations for waste water, no contingency plan for flooding and many more! \\nStupid people in government all they do is steal public funds. Agberos everywhere,\\nPotholes and bad roads! Hell on earth. 😭 || Look at this nonsense! This is why the Lagos government is destroying these useless houses illegally built on drainage. || If you want to live in Lekki, just add a boat to your collection of vehicles. || Thank God for shangotedo down to epe || I remember some 28 years ago before this Lekki boom started, a German company that lost out on the contract bid to develop Lekki made this statement that Lekki will be flooded because it is below sea level and the Lebanese Chagouri brothers they gave the contract to did not dredge Lekki against flood and started building straight away. Now you see the results. || Thank God the Igbos don't own the heavy rain that floods Lekki, else the Governor would have \"demolished\" it. || They said the govt is working on it.

In fact, God's Kingdom will remove the cause of imperfection, sickness and death - sin, as Isaiah 25:6-8 explains.\\n\\n\\nJesus spoke of God's Kingdom some 100 times during his ministry, directing everyone's attention to the only perfect solution to mankind's problems, a heavenly government that will restore the peace lost both to the earth and mankind in the garden of Eden some 6,000 years ago, so that \"meek\" ones can enjoy a paradise earth as their everlasting \"inheritance\".(Ps 37:11, 29; Matt 5:5) || According to meteorological experts  Nigeria could be experiencing El nino rainfall season\\n\\nSo the questions that arise are\\n\\n1. How will the rest of Africa be affected\\nAre we going to see similar flooding in Eastern, central and southern Africa?..\\nAnd how should countries prepare?\\n\\nIn Eastern Africa some countries such somalia, parts of Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya are experiencing droughts on end\\n\\nAll the same  African countries needs to stand with and support our Nigerian brothers and sisters\\n\\nOver to you meteorological experts to guide countries properly || dont live there\\nproblem solved || I don't think it is due to high rain fall.

SICKO NATIONS ARE GONE SOON || THANK CANADAS SATANS THRONE BLESSING FOR THERE FRIENDS || ITS THE END OF YOUR NATION PEOPLE. THE NEW ILLNESS AND PLAGUES WILL TAKE 3.75 BILLION IN 6 MONTHS. || WIPE IT OFF THE MAP || When South Africa was experiencing flooding the insult we got from Nigerians that God is punishing us for Xenophobia and thinking we are better than other African countries. Man it was so bad. Our families insulted by other Africans.  I hope this is a lesson not to wish bad on others. Climate Change is a threat to all of us. We helped Mozambique when they were going through cyclones with SANDF choppers rescuing people.  It's time for AU to intervene and send help before diseases break out. People need help and countries must send direct help. || This is caused by our wicked politicians who don't care our country interest and not taking care of our rivers. || Let’s hope the political elite will not tactically do a dam release flood during the elections to disrupt the “regions” || Please no one should blame Government, let's find solutions to help, people are dieing || These are the end results of unchecked mismanagement and corruption in the systems and institutions of government. Ethnic and tribal politics has certified that Nigeria cannot stand as one nation. Some of these events, have other plots and twists to it. The country has totally collapsed. || What if there will be one in Sulaymaniyah/Slemani? All my cousins are there! || Nigeria. The biggest home off crooks in the world. Hard to feel sorry for people who have financially devastated so many innocents across the world. \\n“Suffering is better than stealing.” Funniest sentence I have ever heard coming from a Nigerian. || God will destroy Nigerian government.  They are mad government.  Their children are abroad.  They care less about us. || It looks like God and the God's are really annoyed, this days some of the  humans are being ignorant and this ignorant is slowly distroying things, too much sinns and disrespecting, some people need to wakeup and think wisely, our fourth fathers would have know what's happening when it starts, but people from today knows nothing, why because they forgotten thier God and the God's, people needs to wake up. Ty. || My heart is broken for our brothers and sisters in that end of Nigeria,sending love from Uganda 🇺🇬 || Let's pray for all humanity in the name of jesus Christ Amen || Hopefully it wipes out all the scammers in Nigeria that rip off all the American people || Anymore it seems it's flood or drought and feast or famine, no more just \"normal.\" || Good presentation of facts DW News. Well done || Now find the stolen money and take care of the people affected by the flood!!!! We are rich as a nation with our resources. || With so much natural resources and looks like a failed state, so sad.. || 🙏🙏🙏🙏 || All boils down to bad government, visionless leaders and bad planning || How come calabar and akwaibom are not flooded? Those other states don't have underground tunnels for drainage I blame their state governors || *LO MAS GRAVE ES VER A LOS ASESINOS REIRSE EN TVE MIENTRAS TE ASESINAN AMORDAZADO EN ESPAÑA.* || The report makes it sound as if a dam could have prevented this, but this is a _lot_ of water. Could a single dam really be sufficient? || I'm Ghanaian, and even though we don't get along well on some things, we need to give and show Nigeria our full support. The world is going through tough challenges right now, so I wish the best to Nigeria, and hope this problem gets taken care of || My condolences to my sisters and brothers in that part of African nation 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬 || Send some of that war money from Ukraine. || Need underground pipes 😶 || Good, clean up scammers. || Lady lives in Canada and fails to earn to speak correctly. || imagine if there was climate change too?????? || As high as the c02 and methane levels are I am shocked that there is not much more flooding.🤔. || We need dams , flood gates, reservoirs , canals  , good government policies...

And most of the people experiencing this ill treatment will still be shouting Emilokan by 2027.\\r\\n\\r\\nTufiakwaa!

The canals would not solve the problems. Some of the government appointees are incompetent and lack planning. This issue occurs every year. Like I mentioned the “Dutch” have similar problems in the past, Lagos State Government should seek their expertise in providing solutions to this problem. Thank You. || Mr. Hon.Commissioner of environment of Lagos state, please sir,, the government of Lagos state is NOT REALLY DOING ENOUGH IN PREVENTING,OR FREEING FLOOD AFTER HEAVY DOWNPOUR IN THE STATE. IN AS MUCH AS THE COMMISSIONER IS RIGHT IN  \"YOU CAN'T CHEAT NATURE \" -  MANY OF THIS FLOODING IS DUE TO THE  I-DONT-CARE ATTITUDES OF RESIDENTS OF LAGOS - YET, MANY HIGHWAYS/ STREETS SIDE DRAINAGES ARE FULL OF ALL SORTS OF SOLID RUBBISH LIKE DEBRIS, PLASTIC PACKS,DISPOSABLE PLASTIC PLATES &amp; BOTTLES, SAND &amp; WEASTE PAPER (INCLUSIVE OF THOSE SWEPT IN BY STREET/HIGHWAYS SWEEPERS);NO PREVENTING BARRIERS TO STOP THESE FROM ENTERING/ BLOCKING THESE STORMS DRAINAGES! IT SEEMS STATE GOVERNMENT IS MORE INTERESTED IN THE ATTITUDE OF 'FILL THE DRAINAGES WITH RUBBISH &amp; WEASTE, WE WILL COME AND CLEAR THEM NEXT YEAR'  -INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PREVENTION OF DRAINAGE BLOCKING 🚫! FLOOD WILL QUICKLY DISAPPEAR FROM ROADS/STREETS AFTER HEAVY DOWNPOUR OF RAINS, IF, THERE IS MUCH MORE SERIOUSNESS ON PART OF GOVERNMENTS(LOCAL/STATE) IN CLEARING, AND TAKING AWAY THE RUBBISH BROUGHT OUT OF THE DRAINAGES TO DUMP SITES WITHIN DAYS - AS IT WAS DURING MILITARY REGIME - AND  NOT TAKING WEEKS TO CLEAR AWAY AS IT IS BEING DONE NOW.\\nEKO O NI BAJE O!

be questioned as he is not taking off wastes in the drainage's in Lagos state. He need to leave his office and start packing bins/waste with his team || The beginning of rain, More is still coming what we have seen was just elementary,greater, greatest is coming. || Is a pity but Lagos should be decongested it's should carry just one third of it population now,. The government should just pay people off, and reduce population and housing before one day the ocean will wash Lagos off this planet. || Everyone ask Nancy I meh for help || The government needs to do what is right toward the people! Fix the drainage and feed your people!!!! || The government needs to do what is right toward the people! Fix the drainage and feed your people!!!! || And tomorrow when the government wants to bulkdoze houses on waterways, some bastards will come up here to say the government is wicked. Na thunder go fire all of una when dey talk that things. Una dey craze. || Lagos state are not making anything possible to avoid it every year same story nawo for Lagos governor || Tinubu built lagos and he's building Nigeria as well left lagos for his boys to finish building it...wayo ppl || Grv warned them ,they wouldn’t listen tribe and hatred have covered there sense of reasoning || APC is working! And to think that the rain jus dey start o!🚶🏽‍♀️ || But thiefnubu said he made Lagos. || Na calm go solve the problem? || They need to invest in some heavy drainage architecture and not focusing on costal highway || Ikorodu people de laugh😂 || Every year they act like rain is a surprise ,so what do you do to avoid it!!! Next year || Lack of waste management and poor drainage system in Lagos is a big problem || Imagine the billions budgeted on infrastructure for Lagos state every year and even the drainage system can prevent flood in Africa's most populated city. Very disappointing || Poor  poor poot drainage system. knocking down people's buildings is not the solution.  Before you cover a drainage, make sure you it is deep and wide enough to contain the quantity of flood in that area. Also, create holes where flood from the road can easily enter the drainage. Stop airtight covering the drainage. || We expect better in 2024  \n",

People poo poo inside nylon and drop in the gutters. \\nPass carter  bridge you will see people weeing and pooing into the lagoon without care. || Even if it didn't rain in Lagos State, domestic waste water does not flow through anywhere it's always stagnat.  Pointing to illegal   construction on canals is a convenient blanket cover to hide the lack of planning drainage system in Lagos State.  Demolishing illegal blockages of structures etc. on canal is a drop in the ocean,  the obvious is that there are no good drainage structures in Lagos State.

Demolition city how far? Remove the Sultan immediately these are wicked people. Kenya united, military and police boys lay down your arms. Let the  Generals and igp go and hug high tension transform 😂😂😂😂 || Lagos will soon take over by Water || Governor Sanwo-Olu and Governor Dapo Abiodun, Please stop using asphalt for road construction. As you can see after just a week of flood receding, pot holes all over the roads. Both Lagos and Ogun State need to bring in experts on how to re-route the flood. I have suggested the “Dutch” use to have same problems in the past, but manage to solve the problem. Open canals in Lagos and Ogun is not recommended but a buried culvert to channel the flood to open sea. Please let us stop wasting public money on projects that doesn’t work. Thank you.  \n",

We do this for large cities in the U S || I cab almost guarantee you that this guy iswell trained professional and maybe US trained. We are taught to serve the  people || Tomorrow you will hear Lagos is small now I'm hearing Lagos is a big place. Hmmmm || Lagos is below sea level and all the yahoo boys turned property developers building on canal ways. Nigerians wake up and stop buying this properties because at the end of the day. The developers have made their billions while you’re left to suffer the consequences loosing all you have worked for. You loose the house and the land because their government land for drainage purpose. The nonchalant attitude of some Lagosians dumping refuse in the canal is another issue. || There is need to restore environmental sanitation even if it is once a month like it used to be some years ago, this way waste can be properly managed. I believe lagos state issue is more of a community service. || Lagos state is full of favouritism. Why give approval to people (I'll call your friends and cronies) to sandfill the lagoon while the government is looking elsewhere for solution to flooding. Water must find its level, so stop the deceit, stop the money bags from sand-filling the lagoon and erecting buildings there, e.g. Oworonsoki end of the third mainland bridge. || The city of Lagos doesn't pick garbage up, what note is he writing ? 😢 || Awon werey TVC ladies || I am not impressed with the explanation of this commissioner cos he lacks proper knowledge of engineering. Simple || Didn't Tinubu built Lagos, a mega city full of knuckleheads. This is an apparent display of lack of engineering knowhow on the part of our not-well-versed, half-baked engineers. Why are they badly constructed structures sinking and others fell flat on their faces...corruption is at the root of these structural debacles. || Shit hole....lekki my foot😮 || I enjoyed this interview. ❤ || Please, LAWMA is not doing much again || Embark on a campaign to reduce the waste! Too much plastic is causing a lot of harm || Let the Lagos state government call Julius beggar construction to handle highways flooding on Ikorodu Road, Agege Motorways, etc, and all these annual flooding will be history. This wonderful construction company handled many deflooding of highways during Alhaji L. Jakande era in lagos state. Also, point of correction of the hardworking Hon.Commissioner of the environment, wet rubbish brought out from drainages, do not have to be dry before being carried to dump site! During Jakande and military eras, these rubbish were taken away immediately  - every rubbish, no matter how massive the rubbish that was cleared - within a day or two after removal. || Somebody is trying to build on a portion that was meant to be a road and on my street subsequently caused flooding. Labsca descended and marked the plot,  stopped work for a while but we don't know what transpired after the initial gra gra by the state officials the owner has since resumed construction and has completely blocked drainages and our road is seriously flooded now || Lagos is not safe. The land is sinking. They keep saying it. People should move inward. || Lagos and Nigeria is a s****h*****!😂 || Which part of demolition city do you live?  After demolishing igbo properties that where built on waterways? Who gave approval to convert flood plains, catchment areas for housing?  Who gave approval to sand fill waterlogs areas?  Yes we have climate change and environmental impact issues Locust president decided to build new coastal super highway to some village called calabar another coastal city. This super highway will be under water. Chief Alhaji Tinubu, the jargaban of Lagos himself alone gave approval. We should not forget what he said about climate change and environmental issues during the campaign, we have the evidence on video 😢😢. This Locust have indeed come to devour.  Congratulations maga city the bride of Asiwaju of Chicago. Ignorance is the worst thing to happen to anyone. 😂😂😂😂 please where is dr betta? I hear she is still collecting her minimum wage of 7mN per month.  To be a sidechic pays well 😂😂😂 || Using climate change and global warming as an excuse by the commissioner is ignorance.....Climate change is man made,it's the result of human activities on nature,not natural.Other countries are building artificial lakes to control erosion and humidity yet lagos state that is actually called lakes is busy sand filling lakes and waterways for estates.Other nations are planting trees to prevent,reduce flooding and climate change, but lagos state government does not understand the importance of planting trees.Nigerian government always using the negative things happening in the west as an excuse,why not build Florida environment and infrastructures in lagos as well then?Thank you. || I do not accept his explanation and excuses.  There is no good drainage structures in Lagos.  If  there should be high water level from the lagoon or whatever,  I see it as blessing that can chanel to produce water in waterworks process and feed back for domestic usage.  The Lagos State governments officials do not fully understand what a  good structural drainage system is.  It seems to me that Lagos State government is not yet in the vision of what is good structural drainage.  Domestic waste water and rain water is not flowing through to anywhere they remain stagnat and later evaporated. The removal of illegal structures on canals is a scratch on the surface. Time will tell. \\nYB || LAGOS STATE IS GRADUALLY SINKING INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN... || I also like that he's taking note.\\nI hope work is been done in these places. \\nWell done sisters ❤ || love you Morayo, keep it up with your weight loss journey. Abeg change your glasses for something more posh. || It's the way the commissioner is so attentive,  patient and calm in his responses.  \n",

Government always saying its the citizens fault. U will use light, they will say, u use it too much😂 || Critical thinking is required. 10-12% of Nigeria’s population lives in Lagos metro area but the infrastructure is insufficient. Those blaming Lagos goverment alone, blame the other successive 35 state governors who have refused to develop more “Lagoses”. \\n\\nIf NY, LA and Chicago were the only places of opportunity in the US the place will be terrible. With 10,000 people moving to Lagos daily from every other state, the city is overwhelmed. A city that size in the US has about 500 bridges, and hundreds  of thousands of miles of drainage covered to prevent putting waste inside. With climate change, Lagos is projected to be mostly under water by 2050 which is not a long time if they don’t stop the move to Lagos that leads to overbuilding & inability to conduct adequate urban planning. Hold every state governor accountable. We have 150 plus “Lagoses” in the US. Why can’t there be opportunities elsewhere? Nigeria is totally dumbed down even from the quality of these conversations. || You are not addressing the issue as it should. Lagos is overpopulated. People should let Lagos be pls! || Na so so suffer for dat country || Lagos is sinking. Lekke is not a safe place to live. People need should move away from Lagos….! || Raising awareness for Lagosian especially the market people to STOP dumping trash or waste on the street, gutter and  drainage should be taking seriously. || Welcome Maryam/ Mariam. Glad you made it to work safely.🙂\\nPerharps everyone on the show, should have a sleep over  in the studio today. Stay safe everyone!! || Thank you Nyman!, I have just commented on the topic. I cannot agree with you more, people will learn. || I hope the people will learn the hard way. They will now protect their drainages and gutters. Go to Alaba market they decorated the drainages with plastics of many colours.\\nYou will learn a hard way. Se you people don’t care you will suffer it until you learn. Incorrigibles!, || Which is one is it. Beggarcity or megashitty. || That's the Lagos Morayo's Dad (Tinubu) built. 😅😅 || Hmmmmm\\nThis is the Lagos that Tinubu built. Just the way he will build Nigeria in the next three years. L OL.\\nMorayo Tinubu daughter be reay to swim o o. || Thank you Nima for speaking the truth. I saw this coming in 2019 when Oba Akran drainages blocked with pet bottles. || Dr. Morayo can not use her beauty to distract us from holding jargaban responsible for everything. Even in the other room it's his fault. Failed Locust government || Climate change, tell them Miriam 😂😂😂 || After demolition of igbo properties built on waterways why's jargaban city flooded? 😂😂😂😂😂 || Jargaban maga city is flooded 😂😂😂😂 congratulations APC you will doing a good job. || This is not coming  as surprised || You should have covered underground drainage system like developed world. Stop blaming people for bad planning. || People from the government came to dredge the carnal in my area and were supposed to demolish the buildings on the carnal while dredging. However the owners of those houses bribed them so they don't demolish their house. This flood is really affecting my area because the water cannot flow || Lagosian should allow Lagos government to open up all blocked drainage, yes some people will be affected by this but it’s for the general good, you can complain about medicine and also complain about been sick  \n",

                                            LET ME BE REALISTIC THIS GOVERNMENT IS IRRESPONSIBLE BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT READY TO ACCEPT THEIR OWN FAULTS THIS CLIMATE PROBLEMS IS NOT A MANMADE PROBLEM ALONE BECAUSE LAGOS STATE DOES NOT HAVE UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE TO TRANSPORT THE EXCESSIVE WATER BACK TO SEA OR RIVERS THE ONLY ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEMS IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IT IS BEEN DONE IN FLORIDA CALIFORNIA ALL COASTAL AREA BECAUSE THEY ARE PRONE TO FLOODING PROBLEMS THE ONLY ANSWER IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM THE COMMISSIONER SHOULD BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY FROM HIS FRAUDULENT CLAIMS WITHOUT UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM LAGOS STATE WILL CONTINUED TO SUFFERED FROM FLOODING PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT IS CLOSED TO A SEA UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM IS THE ONLY ANSWER AND IT SAFE A LOT OF PROPERTIES AND LAGOS STATE WILL BE HAPPY DR ALEX OTTI IS CONSTRUCTING UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM IN ABIA STATE AND THE FLOODING PROBLEMS IS NOW UNDER CONTROL STOPPED FOOLING PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN MONEY STATING THE INFRASTRUCTURES ARE BUILT OVER WATER CHANNELS NOW YOU HAVE DEMOLISHED THE BUILDINGS THE FLOODING PROBLEMS STILL STAYED NOW YOU ARE LYING THEREFORE YOU SHOULD BE REMOVED IMMEDIATELY TOKUNBOH WAHAB LAGOS STATE IS NOT YOUR PLACE STOP DESTROYING INFRASTRUCTURES PLEASE || Them go them go ok || God fights for the Igbos,after all the wickedness from sanolu. || The Lagos State government should mandate all local governments to clear all blocked drainages. They should make it so that they do not get any allocations if they do not clear their drainages. At least that would guarantee they are working and prevent flooding. || In my area people are throwing trash over the bridge of the way to the airport road to Ikeja, constantly. || It's only to break buildings the government knows. They can't dredge the water ways so that water can flow away. It's the governments job to ensure people don't block the drainage system that's what governance is about || Mainland is worse than island this year 😅  \n",

It's the people. I don't know how sane people would clog drainages with their waste. can't they afford 1k a month to dispose of their waste through the right channel? Once it starts raining, you'll see grown up idiots pouring their huge lump of waste into the drainages. No be only gov be our issue for this country. Citizens need to start holding themselves accountable in this country || If local governments actually use money to develop their communities, life will be beautiful. || Dear Sir/Ma,\\n\\n\\nWe write to please bring to your attention the recent illegal sand dredging activities being carried out by the Ibeshe community(Satellite Town, Amuwo Odofin?. \\n\\n\\nThis illegal sand dredging poses a great threat to the Vetsi Sea Beach Community and its neighbouring villages. It has been earlier  recorded that this sand dredging has caused severe erosion to their own community at first and therefore had to stop. They have now shifted and moved closer to the Vetsi Sea Beach Community which is just opposite Ibeshe Community across the Lagos Badagry river with Amuwo Odofin Local Government.\\n\\n\\nWe plead to your agency to use your good office to stop this illegal sand dredging activities in order to avert the lose of lands and properties along the community as well as help save fishing activities which is one of the main occupation of the Vetsi people. \\n\\n\\nWe have attached here a video of the scene and look forward to hearing from you.\\n\\n\\nThank you. || I built Lagos, what a sham || Look at Lagos with the highest IGR  \n",

  I was eagerly looking for a comment on the flood by GRV - This guy is too intelligent.  GRV was one of the consultants called on during Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. He knows his onions, and nobody can tell me otherwise. || Lagosians were asked to choose between competence and incompetence.a minority in connivance with unscrupulous inec.its just unfortunate thst we suffer a short memory i. This part of the world || May God help us in this country called Nigeria 😢😭😢😢😭😢 || God help us in country called Nigeria || This is the reasoning of a slave. They sell lands that was supposed to be for drainages and use the proceeds to give you crumbs during elections. O ma se o.He built Lagos but failed to build a drainage. 24 years in power and can't reduce flooding year in,year out.Have some sense || Nigeria government still managing flood with gutters....so primitive || He knows what he is saying. But I am afraid, governance system in Lagos are rigid and repulsive to these innovative thinking he is saying. || See the type of msn Nigeria  need not thief tinubu and his criminal gangs || Please take your intelligence to the South East. || See mumu in the studio can't you go to your mum's village and ask about their problems, you are not our son you can even pronounced oworoshoki and explain what it means. || My architect ❤pls do not give your advice for free biko cause they won’t still listen || It is interesting  that they  are asking Rhodes- Vivour  if he is willing  to  help   the same  Politicians  and the government who were  his political opponents  in the last election. The same questions they ask Peter Obi with regards  to Nigerian suffering  Economy. || The main reason for the flooding in Lagos is basically as a result of excessive land reclamation by Lagos state government. || GRV you are on point with many people I also ask such questions about the demolitions that have being happening in Lagos with the government claiming they were built on the canal what have Lagos state goverment done what work have they done || Brilliant || GRV is very sound || Clearly, he knows what he's talking about. || Lagos state has been missing good governance bcos the government there since 1999 till date is non visionary rulers that are only visionary to loot,grab power, snatch it, and run away with it. They have nothing to offer,no thinking cap but to share the commonwealth of the people with their boot leaker who are gullible to weaponise ethnic bigotry and tribal sentiment to divide thee people. 😢😢😊 || Once again GRV shows competence, capacity, credibility, compassion and concern while commitment might be lacking due to the need to be clinically insane to tolerate and collaborate with those cheating, lying, ignorant, corrupt crooks. || We need our niger,malian and Faso back || This guy is Sound.  \n",

raining || How can humans live in these dilapidated communities, having paid their taxes to the tax revenue. It is a shameful exposure of lack of Community care, as it is in Lambeth, London where you live in modern slavery environment without the decency and respect to foster community cohesion, and played out as a third world nation standing on an hinged legs of national corruption debate,  with struggling hopeless, immoral and outcaste of territorial integrity of national map. Am emergency office was created to supply beddings to unfortunate victims of the world be citizens, without due regards to the health before hand. It shows you the state of selfish mindset of so called leaders that left you to rot out of the system.  If a dam was constructed to prevent any future disasters forthcoming from landslides, all these empathy would not be necessary. It sewage system as been left to deteriorate, with seemingly cholera poisoning the air around you, affecting the health of children and elderly, whom are at greater risk of ill health, falling victim to early deaths, of statistics published on global platforms. The anger you might express in the displeasure of this news, might make you more sick than the consequences of the environment witnessing this unbearable plight. Understandably, Nigeria is undergoing a major reconstruction for international investors, but are left out on the wayside, being portrayed as lazy, and only subjected to forced police brutality to subdue them into modern slave mentality. Why are they so wicked to the citizens of this country? These Community need to be compensated for the disaster. The last government of President Buhari didn't waste time to apply for government loans to regenerate his homeland community with new houses for both returning refugees and residents displaced by insurgency. Modernising the community with new buildings facilities fit for healthy people, to strive in a new emerging environment, from depilation of Frontier nation. Sadly, communities that undergo landslide and floods are the community estranged from the map. The question Nigerians are not asking their government is quite simple and smart: when are they going to qualify for state, national support from independence? Stop blaming corruption, for your personal failures. Not everyone in Nigeria would accept corrupt means out of their predicaments. This community is nothing less then institutional discrimination against people plaqued with possessing Witchcraft and not deserving better justice for appropriate welfare. They are wrong and God is  witness to this bad treatment of Nigerians. || It's easier to buy blue rail than to do something about the perennial flooding in Lagos || THAT WHY TINUBU MUST GO || Why are you all blocking the passage of erosion with garbage?

Few years time || Ok now you all know why demolition in Lagos island and nothing to do with Ibo period || medicine after death || 2034 , Lagos shall be returned to the Atlantic Ocean. Its below sea leavel not good for investment in this era of rising sea leavel. || Men also need to dress decently😢 || Just imagine sewage water mixed up with the flood '' Ayanma \". || Lekki is a fraud. || This our Nigerian business men in government. || The worst part of this, is that this is supposed to be the highbrow area of Lagos || Come to Ogun state let's build it together. || Where do you leave? || Same problem every year, and nothing has been done.APC next level. || I live on the island. It is well oooooo. || Goverment should develop places like ikorodu, it is far far better than all these fake places || Sorry for those homes that are flooded; hopefully the government will act swiftly to mitigate the situation and assist its citizens.  The flooding is happening globally, especially to construction next to the water ,  below sea level, lagoon, or water pathway.  Everyone should investigate the area for flood before building and purchasing. || Later they ll be making mouth they cant live on the mainland , they cant live there, what am i going to do there ? were they born in Lekki? || 😮😅 || This is what happens when a country lacks systems and structures. Most of this premium estates in Nigeria are in-fact considered ghettos in the first world. Real estate development goes beyond building fancy houses. We have to learn to develop lands and lay proper infrastructure before building on it otherwise we’d keep having these issues, and end up creating beautiful ghettos which are bound to be demolished by future generations.\\n\\nEverything in Nigeria is about making quick money. Nobody cares about standards and creating legacy for our generations unborn. We travel to Europe and the Americas to tour structures built over 500 years ago that are still standing. Travel the length and breath of Nigeria, there is nothing. Our architects have even become so lazy that they can’t ideate. You get an architect to do a project for you and all you get back is copy and paste drawings.\\n\\nEven worse is the fact that the business of real estate agency in Nigeria is unregulated. I learnt this recently and was amazed at the systemic failure that allows such to operate. Every where you go in the world, agents are regulated and required to be registered to their state of practice and attain certain level of training with further requirements for continuous professional developments in other to professionally service the public in line with the laws. However this is none existent in Nigeria which explains why agents can unilaterally jack up property prices with no basis, just to earn more commissions, as you mentioned in one of your videos and even have prospective purchasers pay agency fees that should have been paid by the seller whom the agents are representing.\\n\\nThere has also been incidents where agents provide falsified information to Diasporean buyers claiming the area is not flood prone, whereas it is, just to seal a deal, an act that gives a buyer the right to withdraw from such deal in developed nations at any time as it is classed contract procured through fraud. But in Nigeria there appears not to be any consequences for this and other despicable behaviour hence the reason it keeps happening.\\n\\nSo until we fix our systems and processes, am afraid no amount of demolition could help us. Valuations, town and city planning need to be taken seriously if we would ever get out of this rot we have found ourselves. \\n\\nImagine selling a property for millions of Naira which cannot be underwritten, collateralised or backed up by a basic bank valuation.\\n\\nThe whole system appears to be one big joke! || They built houses where water is supposed to go through. Town planners and developers need to bring an end to this nonsense! || It does not help that everything is covered with concrete. There is no earth or grass to soak up rain, then added to that the lack of any drainage system. People still have boreholes and cholera is a problem. I was looking to invest in Lagos property but after what I saw on a trip last year there I was disappointed. Nigeria just does not work. Let me keep my money in UK and investigate Ghana, South Africa 😑😑 || lolzz, this water dont have any where to go? is channeling water rocket science for Africans? You people should keep pushing government propagandas! || Why do Nigerians give big attention to something because of pride. Every body wants to live in lekki even when its sinking 😂 everybody wants to use iPhone even when they don’t have money to pay for subscriptions, so many stupidity in a country without 24hour  light that if they see 23 hour light they’re proud of it 😂 || Tinubu the Lagos you build is fooled you want apc to rule edo again you lie apc is dead in Nigeria you are dreaming || You guy's have build houses everywhere and if the government wanted to pull down some structures now,people's will complain again || Rain never start well, and it's flooded like this. Ok ooo || Bad planning, poor drainages no flood gates, no pumping stations for waste water, no contingency plan for flooding and many more! \\nStupid people in government all they do is steal public funds. Agberos everywhere,\\nPotholes and bad roads! Hell on earth. 😭 || Look at this nonsense! This is why the Lagos government is destroying these useless houses illegally built on drainage. || If you want to live in Lekki, just add a boat to your collection of vehicles. || Thank God for shangotedo down to epe || I remember some 28 years ago before this Lekki boom started, a German company that lost out on the contract bid to develop Lekki made this statement that Lekki will be flooded because it is below sea level and the Lebanese Chagouri brothers they gave the contract to did not dredge Lekki against flood and started building straight away. Now you see the results. || Thank God the Igbos don't own the heavy rain that floods Lekki, else the Governor would have \"demolished\" it. || They said the govt is working on it. Idk how true that is. This is not cool. || Rubbish || Bro, this just happened?  \n",

THEY ARE IN A SORRY STATE!!!\\nBesides partying and Ojude Ọba celebrations, What exactly is THE GOVERNOR doing?!\\n\\nIfo local govt collecting taxes etc but zero development.\\n\\nElection time, they'll come flexing muscles and claiming Akute and ALL environs as theirs in order to drive votes. We'll meet you at the next election!\\n\\nThere's hunger in the land already, and the infrastructure the people need to move around and earn their little livelihood has become a death trap.\\n\\nJust mount if you're coming for any campaign again on the streets. The people will show you your scorecard and we can compare notes.\\n\\nIre o! || There are no good roads in ogun state. Especially sango, ifo road || Lagos Commissioner of Environment needs and award indeed his a leader. || Sagamu roads are very bad.... || I lived around Oke aro , Matogun area before I was 10 years old. Over 20 years later, it has still not been fixed. As far as I’m concerned this Governor has done nothing to leverage on the proximity to Lagos state. Nothing justifies this kind of injustice to the people living in those areas. Many people have moved out of those areas  because they are in very very very terrible states. This is not the first time this roads have been brought to their attention. They just don’t care! || I wish ambode was the governor of OGUN state || Oh Lord have mercy upon us || They should also work with Google, Apple and other tech companies so that the update is on people's feeds and weather apps. This is simple to do. || We keep playing with serious issues in Nigeria. Ogun State cannot tap into Lagos on development || Help me ask this man .how do they prioritize roads....stakeholders????... || Also TVC please look at your caption statement and edit the error. 🙂 || Dr Wahab is a professional he spoke very well appealing to emotions of the people. Good job! || I learn a lot from TVc platform ❤ || See how Comm Wahab took the feedbacks...Thats what i expected the SSA of Ogun State to do. And can Ogun state govt stop re-inventing the wheel. They should Copy, modify to suit Ogun State makeup and deploy the Lagos state solutions, especially in respect to Road Infrastructure. There should be a blueprint...Ogun is just doing Knee jerk. There are massive opportunities in Ogun State. Ogun should be competing with Lagos.... || This man is just talking rubbish! People living there are calling in and telling you whats up and you are still saying nonsense confidently || We need more  States for Ogun State.  \\nIt seems the  work is too much for a governor to fix.  All the past governors  also did so little to help their people. \\nTherefore, divide the present state into two or three,  we want more  new states  for proper administration. || Ogun State governor have   to  create  strong Local Government authority councils. \\nThere was a time that the Local government authorities repairs our  roads within the state and the roads were properly done for us in the state  and we enjoyed them. \\nMost internal  roads are in terrible condition,  cars are getting bad daily, because of the bad road networks. \\nWe are very tired of your promises, sir.\\nGovernor Abiodun,  please, spend more  money on repairing the roads especially the   Igbeba/Onirugba road, Ijebu Ode. \\nGovernor Abiodun,  please,  create a YouTube Channel for Ogun State activities,  so that we could have more informations of your works within Ogun State. \\nWe need to know them,  sir.\\nThank you sir.  \n",

If she doesn't know that as an infrastructure designed by engineers, then she's talking a lot of nonsense. Even the host tried to get it out of her. Adequate drainage system with proper town/city planning \\nYou cannot build on a floodplain except if you are planning to fish next on stilts in your bedroom. in the future.\\nWhat kind of researcher is she? || 🙏🏾🙏🏾 || its an act of god isnt that what they believe when they kill gays in their country i wonder how many children will get accused of witchcraft for this and beatn or killed . || They are on social media denouncing JESUS  and returning to the worshiping of ancestors whom already have a big plan || Replace climate change with judgment of yah to understand || I pray for the Nigerian people in Jesus’ name. May our Father in heaven rescue the living and help them through their suffering and bereavement. || Climate change is real.

There are 17 dams in Nigeria but  I am  very baffled to find out that there are no dams in the south east of Nigeria. Why? || NIGERIANS ARE STRONG 💪 PEOPLE, THEY WILL GET PASSED THIS IN TIME. 😐😐😐😐 || Our leaders in Nigeria are kleptomaniacs .They would rather steal and live in denial to feather their nest than build critical infrastructure to safeguard lives and property. \\nThey are never proactive. Even in a election season deflooding and flood control is not on the front burner. Even when contracts are awarded for dikes , dams and dredging of waterways, they will be overpriced. \\nTell me , what is the benefit in investing in critical infrastructure without a plan to protect and safeguard such structures? \\nWhere is the wisdom in borrowing bogus sums from international lenders only to misdirect such allocations. This is what you get when corruption is exalted as a way of life. The outcome is misery ,misery and hopelessness. || One day we will get revenge on mother nature || This is crazy || NIGERIA IS THE SCAM CAPITAL OF THE WORLD, GUESS THEY GETTING WAT THEY GIVE || Good news ! || That's heart breaking.

If you have nothing to eat, why the heck would you procreate uncontrollably? This kind of sick, selfish and barbaric behavior should be punishable. This is child abuse! || after the interviews and plenty grammar from researchers and professors in Africa 🌍 the rest is sleeping. why Africa likes public show than actions???? African Government officials are criminals . no better policies || What do you mean by climate change??????  Why do u people always want to perpetrate lies???? The reason for the flooding is the failure of the Nigerian government to build a control dam contain the annual release of the Cameroon dam! Period! Corruption! corruption! In the Nigerian government is the culprit! and not climate change!!!! And when it comes to the climate, the SUN is getting hotter! (And there’s a genuine reason for this!) and not Co2 emissions! This is the truth politicians don’t want to tells their people! || Nigeria is a sin to humanity. We have no government in Nigeria but criminals parading as government in the colonial enterprise of Britain. || We have a president who will exploit any opportunity to travel out of the country, gleeful like a kid in a candy store.  He has no clue whatsoever, yet some selfish and ignorant puppet masters won't face the reality that has befallen out country.  So sad. || Build good sewage system. \\nBuild a dam. || Most of the informations given here is so 💯 wrong || Prayers🙏🏾 up! || The BlameGeria government says the rain is to blame😥 || How can we help? I had no idea about this. || The Nigerian government knew that the rainy season comes every year, and that any monsoon season could bring an unusual heavy rainfall, causing flooding, but yet took no action to have \"safeguards\" in place, \"just in case\". \\n\\n\\nThis is what many political governments do for their people, often nothing, just making promises never fulfilled.(see Prov 25:14 [and please do not twist it wrongly with regard to flooding in Nigeria, but for what it really means] that says: \"Like clouds and wind that brings no rain, is a man who boasts about a gift never given\")\\n\\n\\nBut there is a government that will do much for its people, including taming the weather, as Jesus did at Mark 4:35-39, of healing the sick, as Jesus did at Matthew 9:35, of raising the dead, as Jesus did at John 11:43, 44, of supplying plenty of food, as Jesus did at Matthew 14:14-21.\\n\\n\\nThis government is called God's Kingdom, in which Jesus is it's premier king, it's leader, as Jesus shows at Luke 19:11, 12. In fact, God's Kingdom will remove the cause of imperfection, sickness and death - sin, as Isaiah 25:6-8 explains.\\n\\n\\nJesus spoke of God's Kingdom some 100 times during his ministry, directing everyone's attention to the only perfect solution to mankind's problems, a heavenly government that will restore the peace lost both to the earth and mankind in the garden of Eden some 6,000 years ago, so that \"meek\" ones can enjoy a paradise earth as their everlasting \"inheritance\".(Ps 37:11, 29; Matt 5:5) || According to meteorological experts  Nigeria could be experiencing El nino rainfall season\\n\\nSo the questions that arise are\\n\\n1. How will the rest of Africa be affected\\nAre we going to see similar flooding in Eastern, central and southern Africa?..\\nAnd how should countries prepare?\\n\\nIn Eastern Africa some countries such somalia, parts of Sudan, Ethiopia and Kenya are experiencing droughts on end\\n\\nAll the same  African countries needs to stand with and support our Nigerian brothers and sisters\\n\\nOver to you meteorological experts to guide countries properly || dont live there\\nproblem solved || I don't think it is due to high rain fall. The point is that we have never planned for Any eventualities. There were clear warnings but nothing was done. || ITS CURSED SIMPLE COMMANDED OFF THE MAP. SICKO NATIONS ARE GONE SOON || THANK CANADAS SATANS THRONE BLESSING FOR THERE FRIENDS || ITS THE END OF YOUR NATION PEOPLE. THE NEW ILLNESS AND PLAGUES WILL TAKE 3.75 BILLION IN 6 MONTHS. || WIPE IT OFF THE MAP || When South Africa was experiencing flooding the insult we got from Nigerians that God is punishing us for Xenophobia and thinking we are better than other African countries. Man it was so bad. Our families insulted by other Africans.  I hope this is a lesson not to wish bad on others. Climate Change is a threat to all of us. We helped Mozambique when they were going through cyclones with SANDF choppers rescuing people.  It's time for AU to intervene and send help before diseases break out. People need help and countries must send direct help. || This is caused by our wicked politicians who don't care our country interest and not taking care of our rivers. || Let’s hope the political elite will not tactically do a dam release flood during the elections to disrupt the “regions” || Please no one should blame Government, let's find solutions to help, people are dieing || These are the end results of unchecked mismanagement and corruption in the systems and institutions of government. Ethnic and tribal politics has certified that Nigeria cannot stand as one nation. Some of these events, have other plots and twists to it. The country has totally collapsed. || What if there will be one in Sulaymaniyah/Slemani? All my cousins are there! || Nigeria. The biggest home off crooks in the world. Hard to feel sorry for people who have financially devastated so many innocents across the world. \\n“Suffering is better than stealing.” Funniest sentence I have ever heard coming from a Nigerian. || God will destroy Nigerian government.  They are mad government.  Their children are abroad.  They care less about us. || It looks like God and the God's are really annoyed, this days some of the  humans are being ignorant and this ignorant is slowly distroying things, too much sinns and disrespecting, some people need to wakeup and think wisely, our fourth fathers would have know what's happening when it starts, but people from today knows nothing, why because they forgotten thier God and the God's, people needs to wake up. Ty. || My heart is broken for our brothers and sisters in that end of Nigeria,sending love from Uganda 🇺🇬 || Let's pray for all humanity in the name of jesus Christ Amen || Hopefully it wipes out all the scammers in Nigeria that rip off all the American people || Anymore it seems it's flood or drought and feast or famine, no more just \"normal.\" || Good presentation of facts DW News. Well done || Now find the stolen money and take care of the people affected by the flood!!!! We are rich as a nation with our resources. || With so much natural resources and looks like a failed state, so sad.. || 🙏🙏🙏🙏 || All boils down to bad government, visionless leaders and bad planning || How come calabar and akwaibom are not flooded? Those other states don't have underground tunnels for drainage I blame their state governors || *LO MAS GRAVE ES VER A LOS ASESINOS REIRSE EN TVE MIENTRAS TE ASESINAN AMORDAZADO EN ESPAÑA.* || The report makes it sound as if a dam could have prevented this, but this is a _lot_ of water. Could a single dam really be sufficient? || I'm Ghanaian, and even though we don't get along well on some things, we need to give and show Nigeria our full support. The world is going through tough challenges right now, so I wish the best to Nigeria, and hope this problem gets taken care of || My condolences to my sisters and brothers in that part of African nation 🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇿🇦🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬🇳🇬 || Send some of that war money from Ukraine. || Need underground pipes 😶 || Good, clean up scammers. || Lady lives in Canada and fails to earn to speak correctly. || imagine if there was climate change too?????? || As high as the c02 and methane levels are I am shocked that there is not much more flooding.🤔. || We need dams , flood gates, reservoirs , canals  , good government policies... Etc I could go on... || Islamict want help from the Kafirs? || Nigerian government failed to build their own part of Dam in the 80s after agreement with Cameron. This flood is totally avoidable. This is sad, very sad m || Some are talking about corruption, the others are about a dam.\\nMe: get the F off the river bed, live your life and let nature be nature. || \"Climate change plays small role. The main reason is lack of infrastructure and planning.\" statement joins DW News into climate denier news group. It is irresponsible to undercover climate impacts. || Living in a first world 🌍 country the same same area floods makeshift levees and same happening every few years and government won’t spend nothing on infrastructure. \\n\\nWhich country & state you ask? \\n\\nVictoria Aus the socialist state. \\n\\nThey’re fine sending hundreds of millions to another conflict that doesn’t involve the country technically but won’t fix homeland properly until elections coming || This might wash away the scammers || what is wrong with so many people in the comments blaming the people for living where they do? honestly such a terrible thing to do and chances are no matter where you live youre probably gonna be in an area prone to one form of natural disaster or other. can you imagine losing everything you have or a family member only to hear people criticizing you and blaming you for living in your home??? || Wow.. if government dont want to build a dam, and that was the reason of the flooding… i feel bad for the population  \n",

                          Watch your language. Did I just hear “it’s not time to sulk”? You have no business as a new broadcaster || both presenters laughing when she said climate change is man made..    isn't it humans who are responsible for the environmental events which are leading to climate change? || I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO SAY THE TRUTH UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IS THE ONLY ANSWER PEOPLE PROPERTIES ARE BEING DESTROYED BECAUSE OF EXCESSIVE RAINS DOWNPOURS THIS RAIN CANNOT MOVE ITSELF BACK INTO A RIVER OR SEA THEREFORE UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM IS IMMINENT BECAUSE OF THE THREATS THE RAIN WILL NOT STOPPED THE ONLY ANSWER IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM ALL COASTAL AREAS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE EQUIPPED WITH UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM || THE FLOODING PROBLEMS WILL NOT STOP UNTIL WHEN UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IS CONSTRUCTED OR BUILT COASTAL AREA WILL SUBMERGE FROM FLOODING PROBLEMS WITHOUT UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS THE ONLY ANSWER TO THIS PROBLEM IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM LETS STOP FOOLING AROUND THE ONLY ANSWER IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS THIS PROBLEMS HAS BEEN CONTROLLED IN ADVANCED COUNTRY THROUGH PROPER CONSTRUCTION OF UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS DR ALEX OTTI IS CONSTRUCTING UNDERGROUND DRAINAGES SYSTEMS THROUGHOUT HIS STATE AND THIS FLOODING PROBLEMS IS NOW UNDER CONTROL \\nLAGOS STATE FLOODING PROBLEMS IS NOT A MANMADE PROBLEMS IT IS LAGOS STATE GOVERNMENT LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURES OF UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS IS THE ONLY ANSWER NOT A MAGIC IT IS COMMON SENSE FOLLOW THE CONSTRUCTION INFRASTRUCTURES AND CONSTRUCT UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEM IT IS LONG OVER DUE BECAUSE OF POPULATION INCREASE THE ONLY SOLUTION IS UNDERGROUND DRAINAGE SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURES || This is Tinubu's Lagos that was sold to Nigerians by criminal minded politicians. || With the prevailing environmental and economic situation is obvious that with the Climate Change situation faced in Lagos, only at the Federal Government level can this problem be solved. Lagos is a Federal Territory and should be treated as such. The first step is  to recognize that Lagos is a Federal Territory and immediately revert it back from Statehood to Federal Territory. We must not Forget that Lagos a former Federal Capital Territory was developed with funds from the Federal Account as Abuja is currently being Sustained. || Sanwolu is busy demolishing people house || This   flood   issues   have  been   occurring   and  causes   much   severed   damages   in   the   past   and   present    days   .   Governors   ,  president   and   urban  leaders   needed   to   engaged   these.  people   into  education  / educated  .  You  don't   wait  rainfall   seasons  to  come  before   repairing   roads  ,  gutters   . Sometimes   the   leaders   cuts   down   the  allocations  budgets  to  works  on  roads  and  deposited  millions   into  their  various   or  different  banks   to  attracts  interest   /  high  yeilds  profiting   in  returns  .. There's   so  much  factors  that   affects  road   flooding  . Such  as being  dishonesty   of allocations  for  roads   awards    ,  publics  blocking   levying   which  crestes   assets  for  flooding  . debris   from gutters . Having  knowledge  to  executives   plans  for  road  construction  . || Here's why we are wasting billions of dollars on Climate Change! Long before man ever set foot on Earth, we had the Ice Age, which melted, forming many of the carved valleys that we see today. One perfect example the Grand Canyon and another is Colorado's Garden of the Gods! Every day we hear of more and more forest fires, volcano eruptions and wars, all of which pollute our air! Factories and vehicle pollution is down as far as it needs to be! \\r\\nThe fact is Solar storms are what's causing global warming, by sending flares and coronal mass ejections towards Earth and there's NOTHING we can do to stop it! If the Sun sends just one extra large flare towards us, it's all over folks and the news is forbidden to tell you this, because people will stop sending their kids to college, nobody will invest, so the stock market will collapse, sending the world into a total panic and criminals will run ramped, knowing that a life sentence may only be a year or two at the most!!! || In every city of the world people litter the street, but it's the responsibility of the government to clean it up at the end of everyday, that is why we pay LAWMA tax and other associated taxes to the local government, I am not in support of people throwing stuff around, the government should top their game, most drainages are blocked, contract to carry dustbin is given to close allies, who don't do it properly.. || The Lagos state government should start to fine people who litter public  streets and gutters with litter...! || Ibadan is a far larger city than Lagos in geographical size. Yes. Lagos has a bigger population size. GEN Zs, please take note. || Instead of Gov to do their job but they fucose on demolition of Igbo building || Lagos state government should go and learn from akwa ibom state how to deal with flood. || When animals in power. I think they know what to do but they cant do it. || 😂😂....next yr, and another yr again we will hear same thing...  \n",

                                             They still voted APC 😂😂😂😂😂😂. Let them suffer . || Like it never happened God sees everything he bring it down and he brings it back up || They can begin by cleaning out those gutters and streets. || The whole world sees now that countries like Niger have bigger backbone, more courage that Nigeria can only dream of!!!   Shame on Nigeria,  allowing an oil pipeline to run from Nigeria all the way to Europe, while  Nigerians can't afford to put fuel in their vehicles?\\nThe so called giant of Aftica is a coward nation,  more like the peon of African!!!    \\n\\nLong live Yoruba Nation!!! 🎉 🎉 🎉 || Ask Sanwo Olu to do his job. Let them be more proactive and spend their money on the right projects. Many more roads are in terrible condition. All roads in Lagos State should be tarred normally. || Subsequent Lagos Governor should be serious about creating enough drainage for water to flow away. This had been different in the past.\\n\\nEven for over 50 years, roads that one should expect to be tarred in Lagos are not tarred in the state with the highest resources and money available to him. || Shameless country,Tinubu& his cronies are busy sharing the country 's wealth,it shall not be well with you people that destroyed and still destroying Nigeria || This is the beginning... God is not happy with Yoruba's... The ways you guys treated Igbos during this Election || Lagos state government is not yet serious enough about reducing flooding lagos state. Firstly, most of the streets drainage constructed by the state were not supervised; hence, many were sand & rubbish filled at point of construction. Secondly,most  highways &Street sweepers swept sand and dirt into roadside drainage water inlet hoes! Go to Ebute Metta, Mushin, Orile, Aggege, etc; even this Channels TV video here  -drainages are filled with rubbish! No matter how Aggege motor road in Mushin, and end of Redemption way - towards RCCG HQ , in Lagos mainland- is cleared, the storm drainage channels are mostly filled with used  Tetra Paks for food & empty pet bottles! Local governments are not doing their duties like before; and state authorities are not  sanctioning citizens for turning drainages into instant dust bins. The last time that public environmental sanitation worked - public drainages cleared regularly, special mini lawma vans  taking away highways sweepers refuse daily -was during Gov. Raji Fashola regime. May Almighty Mercyful God help perfect lagos state, our center of excellence. || Thanks for your good job information Ma ❤️💙❤️ and God bless Federal Republic of Nigeria 🇳🇬 Amen 🙏🇳🇬💚🤍💚  \n",

Nothing will change there || You can call god, allah, Jesus…. When you can’t use your brains to manage your cities. Your lagos is sinking and will soon be under water… where are your engineers that you boast off? || God have mercy. Despite NIMET warnings,what is our govt doing and what are we doing as a people to avert a future reoccurrence of this ugly situations? || I think my going to buy house in mowe ofade  no regret thank God  but am so sorry for my people || Global warming is real. Many states will be affected according to prediction. Besides Lagos is surrounded by water. || No build drainage na to demolish dey una mind || This is the Lagos that thief tinubu built. Hahahahaha || Mechanic for those affected areas go cash out, big time. || No one can cheat nature. It will always fight back in its own way.  Lagos state is busy sand filling oceans and lagoons and building houses on them. Have they taken the pain to ask nature where it will relocate the displaced body of water that the ocean lagoons used to hold as reservoir? || God supersedes  everything  human beings  can achieve. || Nigeria we hail thee. || Thought Tinubu build Lagos? If you like come for me all Aja Emilokan.  Am waiting.. || Is this the Lagos state, tribalistic Yorubas said that Ahmed Bola Tinubu, built, mad people. || This will claim lives, injure many and affects many businesses. For those supporting  APC led govenor in Lagos state.

What a mega city ! The pride of Africa 😅😅😅.\\nTinubu built Lagos. They fools are stranded everywhere while Tinubu is cruising in the villa buying the most expensive world  jets for himself and family.\\nBigotry yorubas, how market? Enjoy your dividends of tribalism.\\nPlease, swim safely into your fools paradise. Umu efulefu. Ndi nzuzu. || Sanwo olu is the laziest and worst governor we ever had. || 𝑆𝑒𝑒 𝑜𝑢𝑟 𝑏𝑒𝑎𝑢𝑡𝑖𝑓𝑢𝑙 𝑏𝑖𝑔𝑔 𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑒𝑘𝑜 𝑜 𝑛𝑖 𝑏𝑎𝑗𝑒, 𝑓𝑙𝑜𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑙𝑖𝑘𝑒 𝑣𝑖𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠 || We are on the same LEVEL as Dubai. || 0:49 guy in the prado is laughing.😅 || This also happens in new york, tycoon in japans and co, if nature goes out of control. Those that blame Tinubu and lagos for natural cause should go and fixed their state. No be by force to remain in lagos. When sanwo olu was destroying houses around canals and pipelines, same people with big mouth were coining it around politics and tribe. Yeeye people || Nigeria is a giant of Africa even the world knows that || You dey live on top of water and you dey complain about water. || Guys be careful watch your steps for gutters || Trully, this city was crafted and built by Tinubu, are you not convinced by now. || \"water no get enemy\"\" || Njenje TV, you and your Igbo people are just too bitter ethnic people of low self-esteem. Flooding is a natural occurrence, it comes and go, and happens anywhere in the world. We have seen similar situation in great cities of Europe, America, Japan, even in the desert of Saudi Arabia and Dubai.\\n Thanks for the video, it just give us here in Lagos more motivation to go further to go around to look for houses own by Igbos and tear them down, claiming the houses are standing on water ways.\\n From last year, there is never going to be peace of mind for Ndigbo in Lagos again. || What is the name of the river ?

If that is the case , why is it being shown like it is of recent? Interesting. || Tinubu never built anything in Lagos. Tinubu destroyed Lagos || This is slightly worse than what I saw in Okota, Lagos in 2011. Very horrible flooding happened in July 2011 after the heavy rain of July 10,2011 || Tinubu built Lagos || Very unorganized entity with no sense of human || Nigeria there country. || Suffering and smiling. || Double joepardy. If they dont demolish your house senselessly, the flood will do it for them .And properties are going for 100's of thousands of dollars in this hood. || Rubbish state everywhere in that State is  nasty 🤮 😷 and smells , disgusting I don’t know what people are Looking for in that state. Last time I visited Nigeria, I stayed in my aunt’s house , when I wanted to take a walk in the evening big ,big rats 🐀 that scared the heck out of me, I just went back to the house. This president tinubu is a total failure. || Welcome to the pool state of Nigeria. Tinubu built Lagos abi. Mad people everywhere || Which one concern Tinubu here, Lagos get Governor na. || Nawoo,God have mercy || This one na swimming pool || In a working system, who is an agbero (a lout) to try this? They are one of the major reasons I don't ever want to reside in Lagos cos rubbish dey quick vex me. And the Idiots of leaders won't see this. People are already going through so much due to government carelessness and greed. Lagos of post independent era was quite organised than what we have today, yet some people would claim one man built it. More like, one man destroyed it.\\r\\n\\r\\nImagine going to market and not selling anything due to today's heavy downpour resulting in serious floods owing to habitual leadership neglect and laxity on town planning, and you decide to wade into the dirty waters to head back home with all the risk attached to it, only to be stopped and asked to pay to cross a seemingly better part of the road by agberos who have no constitutional business being there in the first place. And most of the people experiencing this ill treatment will still be shouting Emilokan by 2027.\\r\\n\\r\\nTufiakwaa! Tuuueeeh! || Another rain in lagos then || That's just the beginning.\\nU idiots has been pushing the water for years by sand feeding it's space.\\nNow it has start to push back... || This is the state/city Bola Tinubu claims to have built. Despite generating trillions in IGR, it still struggles with common issues like flooding. MEGA SLUM. || This is dead serious oooo || Tinubu built Lagos eh, I dey see am. || Nigeria is finish...

and Gentlemen and Mr. Commissioner, the Lagos State Government forget during the development land to take into consideration the provision of retention pond to collect the rain and flood water before being discharging into an open sea. The canals would not solve the problems. Some of the government appointees are incompetent and lack planning. This issue occurs every year. Like I mentioned the “Dutch” have similar problems in the past, Lagos State Government should seek their expertise in providing solutions to this problem. Thank You. || Mr. Hon.Commissioner of environment of Lagos state, please sir,, the government of Lagos state is NOT REALLY DOING ENOUGH IN PREVENTING,OR FREEING FLOOD AFTER HEAVY DOWNPOUR IN THE STATE. IN AS MUCH AS THE COMMISSIONER IS RIGHT IN  \"YOU CAN'T CHEAT NATURE \" -  MANY OF THIS FLOODING IS DUE TO THE  I-DONT-CARE ATTITUDES OF RESIDENTS OF LAGOS - YET, MANY HIGHWAYS/ STREETS SIDE DRAINAGES ARE FULL OF ALL SORTS OF SOLID RUBBISH LIKE DEBRIS, PLASTIC PACKS,DISPOSABLE PLASTIC PLATES & BOTTLES, SAND & WEASTE PAPER (INCLUSIVE OF THOSE SWEPT IN BY STREET/HIGHWAYS SWEEPERS);NO PREVENTING BARRIERS TO STOP THESE FROM ENTERING/ BLOCKING THESE STORMS DRAINAGES! IT SEEMS STATE GOVERNMENT IS MORE INTERESTED IN THE ATTITUDE OF 'FILL THE DRAINAGES WITH RUBBISH & WEASTE, WE WILL COME AND CLEAR THEM NEXT YEAR'  -INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON PREVENTION OF DRAINAGE BLOCKING 🚫! FLOOD WILL QUICKLY DISAPPEAR FROM ROADS/STREETS AFTER HEAVY DOWNPOUR OF RAINS, IF, THERE IS MUCH MORE SERIOUSNESS ON PART OF GOVERNMENTS(LOCAL/STATE) IN CLEARING, AND TAKING AWAY THE RUBBISH BROUGHT OUT OF THE DRAINAGES TO DUMP SITES WITHIN DAYS - AS IT WAS DURING MILITARY REGIME - AND  NOT TAKING WEEKS TO CLEAR AWAY AS IT IS BEING DONE NOW.\\nEKO O NI BAJE O! GOD BLESS & PROTECT LAGOS STATE THE MORE! || While I applaud the good work of our media houses, I could see that practically all of you are having to rely on the amateur videos, instead of setting out with drones and your own devices. || Greedy politicians,liars  \n",

Corrupt government in power see your life. .can't even fix canal blockage around. Lagos state shame . || Corrupt government in power see your life. .can't even fix canal blockage around. Lagos state shame . || Why citizens putting garbage in canal. Governor of Lagos state are you blind or just a wicked human being..this is the major problems they elect you for ..pls do your job and stop looting like Ambode past governor .. || Nija don expire teh teh || So the whole of nigeria no one can clean the garbage up || So there are no garbage collectors in Nigeria?? Or whaaaat? || If the flood crisis is not handled in Lagos there is a likelihood that Lagos would sink. They aren't planning Lagos properly....giving permits to sites where buildings are not supposed to be situated.....the reclamation of bar beach and other parts of Lekki is also a tradeoff of the flood situation when it rains.....The drainage in Lagos are not built manhole....waste is another critical problem of Lagos....Waste management is poor hence most of the wastes find their way into the drainage system which eventually gets blocked.....Lagos would be in a serious mess if these issues are not addressed on time as the sea levels are also rising.......  \n",

The contractor are only interest in their money but you the land lord is the one to determine your house. Africa are ruled by people without visions  .Today we can not solve the problem of Africa  we are waiting for God to come from heaven to save, tell me what it can cost our leaders to open all the countries in Africa to have their seaports, I know that with 50billion Naira we can create artificial ocean across Africa to unlock all The countries. We can open 10m deep and 2km wide ocean from Mozambique to Niger down to Lagos /Benin Republic. The profit is everlasting and we are still waiting for God, Africa wake up  \n",

shore line is a red flag. It make the barrier sand at the mouth of the shoreline to slump further into the ocean.\\nAlso creates more energy for the waves || There is poor land use management and environmental conservation....in kenya we overcame these challenges by planting mangroves and retaining beaches to their natural state || Land use mismanagement: it's a governmental issue and they are likely being paid to look the other way.  You can't dredge without proper consideration of erosion control. || So stop adding to the population. If unable to provide for kids then don't have kids. || Why not plant mangroves? || Someone mining the sand 😮... put sand in a clear vase with water and vacuum the sand from any point 👉 and see 👀 🤔 what happens 💯🤔🙄👀 || Plant trees, specifically anti-land erosion trees at the beaches.  \n",

      "•Seven rescued from collapsed building, flood-induced traffic disrupts movement in Lagos, Ogun\n",
      "Business and commercial activities were grounded on Wednesday following a 10-hour downpour in many parts of Lagos and Ogun states.\n",
      "The resulting flooding brought down a two-storey building in the Mushin area of Lagos, grounded vehicular movement on the roads and overwhelmed thousands of residents while pupils could not attend schools in parts of the states.\n",
      " Though the Lagos State government said the rain lasted for nine hours, in some parts of the state,  it started at midnight and did not subside until noon, making it 12 hours.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such places include Berger, Ikeja, Ogba and in some parts, the rain lasted for 10 hours.\n",
      "Our correspondents, who visited some affected flooded areas such as Iyana-Oworo, Agege, Ijegun-Isheri Osun, Gbagada and Lagos Island in Lagos State, observed that roads and houses were flooded as a result of long hours of downpour.\n",
      " Other flooded places in Lagos include Eredo, Bojije, Epe, Sangotedo, Ibeju-Lekki, Awoyaya, Labora, and Abijon.        \n",
      " The PUNCH also visited Atan-Ota, Aseese, Ifo, Sango-Ota, and Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State and observed that major roads were  submerged, making them impassable and leaving passengers stranded.\n",
      "The heavy showers, which began around 12am, were blamed for the collapse of a two-storey building on Cameroon Road in the Mushin area of Lagos, injuring seven people.\n",
      "The Permanent Secretary of the Lagos State Emergency Management Authority, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, stated that the seven victims were rescued alive from the collapsed structure.\n",
      "He attributed the collapse of the newly constructed building to the inclement weather.\n",
      "He said, “Early this morning, seven people were rescued alive from a building in Ewenla, Mushin, that collapsed in the inclement weather.\n",
      "“Upon arrival of the LRT at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that a newly constructed two-storey building had collapsed. Three females and four males were rescued alive and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.\n",
      " “The agency’s search-and-rescue team had searched the rubbles and can confirm that there is no victim underneath the collapsed building. The area has been cordoned off, and operations are still ongoing.”     \n",
      "Non-essential travels\n",

      "•Seven rescued from collapsed building, flood-induced traffic disrupts movement in Lagos, Ogun\n",
      "Business and commercial activities were grounded on Wednesday following a 10-hour downpour in many parts of Lagos and Ogun states.\n",
      "The resulting flooding brought down a two-storey building in the Mushin area of Lagos, grounded vehicular movement on the roads and overwhelmed thousands of residents while pupils could not attend schools in parts of the states.\n",
      " Though the Lagos State government said the rain lasted for nine hours, in some parts of the state,  it started at midnight and did not subside until noon, making it 12 hours.  \n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Such places include Berger, Ikeja, Ogba and in some parts, the rain lasted for 10 hours.\n",
      "Our correspondents, who visited some affected flooded areas such as Iyana-Oworo, Agege, Ijegun-Isheri Osun, Gbagada and Lagos Island in Lagos State, observed that roads and houses were flooded as a result of long hours of downpour.\n",
      " Other flooded places in Lagos include Eredo, Bojije, Epe, Sangotedo, Ibeju-Lekki, Awoyaya, Labora, and Abijon.        \n",
      " The PUNCH also visited Atan-Ota, Aseese, Ifo, Sango-Ota, and Ijebu-Ode in Ogun State and observed that major roads were  submerged, making them impassable and leaving passengers stranded.\n",
      "The heavy showers, which began around 12am, were blamed for the collapse of a two-storey building on Cameroon Road in the Mushin area of Lagos, injuring seven people.\n",
      "The Permanent Secretary of the Lagos State Emergency Management Authority, Olufemi Oke-Osanyintolu, stated that the seven victims were rescued alive from the collapsed structure.\n",
      "He attributed the collapse of the newly constructed building to the inclement weather.\n",
      "He said, “Early this morning, seven people were rescued alive from a building in Ewenla, Mushin, that collapsed in the inclement weather.\n",
      "“Upon arrival of the LRT at the scene of the incident, it was discovered that a newly constructed two-storey building had collapsed. Three females and four males were rescued alive and taken to a nearby hospital for treatment.\n",
      " “The agency’s search-and-rescue team had searched the rubbles and can confirm that there is no victim underneath the collapsed building. The area has been cordoned off, and operations are still ongoing.”     \n",
      "Non-essential travels\n",
      " Due to the unpredictable weather conditions, the LASEMA boss also urged Lagos residents to remain calm and avoid any non-essential travel.\n",
      " “We are urging the good people of Lagos to remain calm and refrain from any non-essential travel due to the incidence of flash floods across the state,” he added.\n",
      " Students currently taking exams were affected by the downpour as some schools in White Sand Estate, Isheri-Osun, in the Alimosho Local Government Area of Lagos, closed.\n",
      "The students were advised to stay home due to the hazardous roads.\n",
      "The PUNCH reports that White Sand Estate is one of the hardest-hit areas in Lagos, frequently experiencing severe flooding.\n",
      "Flooding in White Sand Estate is a recurring issue, with the area suffering from poor roads, inadequate drainage systems, and a lack of maintenance.  \n",
      "Wednesday’s downpour once again flooded homes, with water reaching mid-level levels.\n",
      "Our correspondent observed that many residents were trapped in their apartments, unable even to sit down as their living spaces were submerged.\n",
      "A parent, identified simply as Atinuke, shared a message from the school with our correspondent, praising the school’s management for their “pragmatic” decision.\n",
      "The message read, “Good morning, dearest parents, trust your night was splendid. Due to the heavy downpour and a predicted serious rainy weather forecast today, we have decided to close the school and postpone today’s exam. As you can see, almost everywhere is flooded.\n",
      " “As a school, we prioritise the safety of our geniuses above everything else. Consequently, the school bus will also not operate today. We are extremely sorry for the inconvenience.”\n",
      "Atinuke called for the state government’s intervention, lamenting that water had flooded her living room, forcing her to remove the furniture.\n",
      "She said, “The rain has entered my house again; just look at the environment. This is White Sand Estate in Isheri-Osun.”     \n",
      "The area was flooded, making it impossible for cars and motorcycles to navigate, while the pedestrians faced significant risks as the flooding obscured drainage channels.\n",
      "The Public Relations Officer of the area’s Community Development, Johnson Olabode, expressed his frustration, stating, “We are at it again this year. Everywhere is filled with water. I have been up since 3am when the rain started, and all I could do was watch my house get flooded. We can’t even start removing the water until the rain stops.”\n",
      "He added that schools have notified parents to keep their children at home due to the severe conditions.\n",
      "Meanwhile, some residents have called on the Lagos State government to urgently address this ongoing problem in their community.\n",
      "A resident, identified as John Adewale, decried that the flooding had become a yearly nightmare for them.\n",
      "He said, “This has become a yearly nightmare for us. Every time it rains heavily, we know our homes will be flooded. We’ve been pleading with the government for better drainage systems, but nothing seems to be happening. We’re stuck inside with water everywhere.”\n",
      "Flood submerges roads        \n",
      "Major roads such as Majek, Abraham Adesanya, and Awoyaya-Sangotedo were also impacted, with ongoing road construction further worsening the situation.\n",
      "Commercial vehicles and motorcycles seized the opportunity to hike transport fares.\n",
      "A resident, Anuoluwapo Atanda, in the Pen Cinema, Agege area of Lagos, said that the flood affected her house due to the blocked drainage in her area.\n",
      "She revealed that it also impacted all the houses on her street and the adjacent one.\n",
      "Atanda said, “Flooding is an issue here because residents refuse to clean their drainage systems. The main reason for the flood is the dirty and congested drainage filled with waste.\n",
      "“The government is trying to create a larger drainage system on the link road to my street, but the work has been slow and rough. I think this season is not the right time to do it.\n",
      " “They just dug the drainage, but water is not flowing in it because it hasn’t been completed. Once the water in the gutter fills up, it flows into the road and people’s houses.     \n",
      "“Traffic has been terrible because of the flood. Drivers are being careful so they don’t sink with their vehicles, as it is difficult to identify potholes and gutters when everywhere is flooded. It took me about 45 minutes to get to Oshodi from Agege; everywhere is messed up.”\n",
      " A resident on X.com who goes by the name, Chu Osakwe, stated, “This is Gbagada to 7up inward 3MB. Stay home if you have no business on the island. #Traffic.’’\n",
      "“If your route this morning is mainland to the island via 3MB, just forget it. Turn back home or reroute. I just passed by on the opposite side, and the beginning of the Third Mainland (Iyana woro?) is flooded to the car doors. I’ve never seen that on the bridge before,” another X user wrote on Wednesday.\n",
      "“Please let me adjust my advice. If you live in Lagos, do not even consider coming out of your house today. Everywhere is flooded. I didn’t expect it to be this bad on the mainland. Flooded, and all the roads are blocked in any direction,” the resident added.\n",
      "Our correspondent who visited Ikeja observed stranded commuters forced to find shelter, while others stood by the roadside waiting for commercial buses to take them to their destinations.\n",
      "The PUNCH also noted that some commercial buses refused to pick up passengers travelling from Ogba to Ikeja due to the flood and traffic gridlock.\n",
      "Additionally, broken-down vehicles further compounded the plight of motorists.     \n",
      "A driver identified as Tunji blamed the flooding on the poor drainage system in Ikeja.\n",
      "He said, “The drainage system in Ikeja is inadequate; there’s nowhere for the water to flow, so it stays in one place, damaging cars and other properties.\n",
      "“The demand for buses is greater than the supply due to the rain. That is why we don’t have vehicles ready to go to Ikeja. The supply went down because of the flood and gridlock. It is a sad thing, but what can we do?\n",
      "‘’We can’t force them to spoil their vehicles just because we want to get to work. It is not fair.”\n",
      "Fare hike\n",
      "The PUNCH also observed that commercial bus drivers and tricycle riders increased the transport fare from the usual N300 to N700 for trips from Ogba to Ikeja.\n",
      "A 54-second viral video showed hoodlums extorting residents, demanding a N100 levy before allowing them to access an alternate route under the Trade Fair bridge in the Ojo area, following the flood that submerged much of the area.     \n",
      "Some individuals were arrested by officials of the Lagos State Government for allegedly extorting the residents.\n",
      "“This is the Trade fair under-bridge; pay N100 before you can take the passage. And we have a president in this country. Look at their faces,” a woman’s voice in a video clip said.\n",
      "The Commissioner for Environment, Tokunbo Wahab, stated on his X.com handle that the miscreants had been arrested by the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps and assured that they would be prosecuted accordingly.  Related News  10 states battling flooding, 21 others at risk, FG warns  61-year-old electrocuted in Lagos  Katsina Emir, farmers pray for rainfall as strange worms destroy crops   \n",
      "He wrote, “Following a complaint made by @ARISE0214, miscreants charging people for using the makeshift crossover bridge at Trade fair this morning (Wednesday) have been arrested by the operatives of the Lagos State Environmental Sanitation Corps, @LAGESCOfficial. They will be prosecuted according to the law.”\n",
      "Devastating floods also struck several communities in Ogun State, including Sango-Ota, Alagbado, Atan, Oju-ore, and Lusada, submerging them.\n",
      "Residents attributed the flooding to blocked waterways caused by indiscriminate waste dumping and construction on drainage rights-of-way.\n",
      "Abayomi Rufai, a resident of Atan-Ota, reported that his properties worth several millions of naira were damaged by the rainfall.     \n",
      "He blamed the flooding on improper drainage channelling and construction on drainage rights-of-way in his community.\n",
      "He lamented, “Currently, I can’t access my house. I have to rely on commercial motorcycles because the road leading to my house is currently cut off from the major road due to the flood. Governor Dapo Abiodun should come to our aid before it is too late.”\n",
      "Victoria Ojelana, a resident of Oregun in the Ijebu-Ode area, told our correspondent that her entire apartment was flooded, destroying some household items.\n",
      "She explained, “I was sleeping only for me to wake up and see everywhere flooded. The flood was very bad; it entered our house, our kitchen, and even our neighbour’s house.\n",
      "“There is a neighbour of ours that, even with the fence, the flood broke down the fence, entered their room, and they had to run out of the house. They waited for three to four hours so that the water could reduce. The water is not flowing, it is just stagnant.”\n",
      "In response to the situation, the Lagos State Government has called for calm.\n",
      "Non-stop rain     \n",
      "A statement signed by the Commissioner for Environment and Water Resources, Wahab, explained that Lagos experienced about nine hours of non-stop rainfall since the early hours of Wednesday.\n",
      "He added that this was coupled with heavy rainfall which the state had been experiencing daily since last week resulting in the level rise of the Lagos lagoon.\n",
      "Wahab explained that the flash floods which inundated areas like Iyana Oworo linking the Third Mainland and several other areas would recede once the rains abated.\n",
      "The commissioner added that the state had also deployed officials of the Emergency Flood Abatement Gang to major black spots, including Iyana Oworo, which has been cleared of all blockages.\n",
      "He urged “All those in low-lying areas, to as a matter of necessity,  relocate to higher grounds at this period to safeguard lives and properties.”\n",
      "He also admonished residents to desist from wading through floods with their vehicles as they could be swept away, irrespective of the number of occupants.\n",
      "The commissioner equally advised residents to avail themselves of daily weather reports issued by the State Ministry of the Environment and Water Resources as it serves as a guide to daily itineraries.     \n",
      "Ogun State was also affected by the rainfall with places like Iperu, Governor Dapo Abiodun’s home town, Oju Ore, Joju bus stop along the Abeokuta-Sango Ota Expressway and Sango-Ota under-bridge impacted by flooding.\n",
      "A Sango-Ota resident, Mrs Adijat Ahmed, stated, “I  observed slight flooding around Joju bus stop, Oju Ore and Sango-Ota under-bridge and this I think is as a result of the rain but it is however nothing so threatening. It is the usual thing during rainy season like this.”\n",
      "Mr Moses Ayinla also confirmed that there was slight flooding on Iperu-Ilisan Road.\n",
      "“There was slight flooding on Ilisan-Iperu road due to the downpour but this is not new; the road has always been flooded whenever there is heavy rain, though, the water will later flow away after some hours.\n",
      "“The problem of that place is drainage and there was a time the government actually worked on the spot but the problem is back, so we plead with Gov Dapo Abiodun to provide the final solution to this problem,” he said.\n",
      " Owolabi Babalola, a resident of Wawa located just before the long bridge, Lagos-Ibadan Expressway,  said that there was no incident of flooding in the area.\n",
      "Babalola noted, “The rain is a bit much here too but there is nothing like flooding, even on the long bridge. I just came back home, I never experienced anything of such on the road.     \n",
      "“Though sometimes the place is flooded as a result of excessive rainfall but I didn’t see anything of such when going to work and coming back this evening; probably, it has receded.\n",
      " “The problem we usually have here in Wawa is not the rain but when the dam is overflowed and it is now opened to empty the water; that is when we used to have issues. We plead for more government support and collaboration to ensure that this challenge becomes a thing of the past.”\n",
      "Ogun allays fears\n",
      "The Ogun State Commissioner for Environment, Ola Oresanya, assured worried residents, stating that there was nothing to fret about.\n",
      "“Just like we have stated in our flood alert issued to members of the public in April, the NIMET has said that between July 3rd to 13th, there will be flash flooding in some parts of the state because the rain would have been reaching its peak.\n",
      "“The flood will appear when there is a downpour and disappear hours later. If you go back to where there have been reports of flooding in the morning, the water would have gone by now; it is a natural occurrence.\n",
      "“The residents only have to be careful and ensure that they only go out when it is necessary. We should also ensure that we work on our drainages just like the state government has done to ensure there is a free flow of water,’’ he advised.     \n",
      "Benin, the Edo State capital, experienced slight flooding during Wednesday’s downpour.\n",
      "Vehicular movement was disrupted in places like Commercial Avenue, Reservation Road, Ikpopan, Aghobasiwin, Ihama and Adesua Road, all in the Government Reservation Area, due to flooding.\n",
      "The road by the Prestige Hotel on Ihama Road and Aghobasiwin Street was rendered impassable.\n",
      "However, vehicles were seen moving at a slow pace at Ikpopan, Reservation Road and Commercial Road close to the Government House and Nigeria Army, 4 Brigade.\n",
      "Two residents, Blessing and Ife, attributed the situation to a lack of drainages in the GRA.\n",
      "Ado Ekiti, the Ekiti State capital, witnessed light rain showers for less than half an hour on Wednesday.\n",
      "Although it was not accompanied by thunderstorms or flooding, it disrupted commercial and other activities in the capital city.     \n",
      "An Okada rider identified himself simply as Raymond, who alongside his colleagues, took shelter under the Fajuyi – Ojumose Flyover Bridge, said, “These light showers, as you can see, have disrupted many things. For me, the rains have affected what I will make. I am sure the rains will affect how people will come out because the weather is cold, very cold.”\n",
      "A commuter, Bola Olugbemi, said, “The brief rainfall has disrupted many things. Traders, mostly those who displayed wares in open spaces and hawkers at the popular Oja Bisi and Oja Markets as well as in the capital city ran for shelter from the rains. Things will not remain the same throughout the day again.”\n",
      "Residents of Akure were also impacted by the torrential rain which slowed down economic and social activities in the Ondo state capital and other communities.\n",
      "It was learnt that many state workers reported late for work and some shop owners could not open for business.\n",
      "However, there was no report of flooding across the state.\n",
      "In Anambra State, residents were not spared as parts of the state were flooded by the rains that started at about 2pm on Wednesday.\n",
      "Particularly affected was Neni community in the Anaocha Local Government Area of the state with several roads and homes submerged.     \n",
      "Vehicular movement was disrupted in places like Onitsha, the commercial nerve centre of the state.\n",
      "Motorists and commuters experienced severe gridlock on the Onitsha-Owerri Road.\n",
      "The jam on the ever-busy road stretched from the Upper Iweka to the Enamel area of the road.\n",
      "The situation was worsened by some naval ratings manning a checkpoint at Enamel. They were observed extorting motorists plying the road.\n",
      "They collected amounts ranging from N100 from tricycle operators, N200 from shuttle bus drivers and N500 and N1,000 from truck drivers.\n",
      "They blocked a part of the road to carry out their illegal act.\n",
      "The ratings were also seen flogging motorists who refused to part with money.     \n",
      "Many people were forced to trek for a long distance following the traffic situation on the Onitsha-Owerri Road.\n",
      "A road user, who gave her name as Ifeoma Okeke, said, “This Onitsha-Owerri Road is a critical road for us in the South-East and naval officers have continued to make life unbearable for motorists on the road.\n",
      "“Despite the gridlock they have caused with their checkpoint, we also suffer from extortion. Look at the way they have blocked more than half of the two-lane road in the name of a checkpoint and are using it to extort us.”\n",
      "In Awka, the state capital, vehicles were forced to move at a slow pace due to the flooding on the Awka-Enugu Expressway.\n",
      "Residents blamed blocked drainages in the area for the flooding.\n",
